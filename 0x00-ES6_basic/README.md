# ALX Backend JavaScript - 0x00-ES6_basic

This repository contains the code for the ALX Backend JavaScript project, specifically the module 0x00-ES6_basic. This module focuses on the basics of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and aims to enhance your understanding of modern JavaScript concepts and features.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of ES6 and its importance in modern JavaScript development.
- Demonstrate knowledge of new features introduced in ES6.
- Differentiate between constants and variables and understand their usage.
- Implement block-scoped variables effectively.
- Utilize arrow functions and understand function parameters defaulting to them.
- Leverage rest and spread function parameters for efficient code implementation.
- Apply string templating techniques in ES6.
- Create objects and utilize their properties using ES6 syntax.
- Understand the concept of iterators and utilize for-of loops effectively.

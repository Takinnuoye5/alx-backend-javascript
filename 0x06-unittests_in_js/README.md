## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Use Mocha to write a test suite
- Utilize different assertion libraries (Node's built-in assertions or Chai)
- Present lengthy test suites effectively
- Understand when and how to use spies
- Understand when and how to use stubs
- Grasp the concept of hooks and their application
- Perform unit testing with asynchronous functions
- Write integration tests using a small Node.js server
